In the 60 years of creative activity encompassed by this volume, the artist produced scores of sketches, drawings, and studies -- nudes, heads, figure studies, Madonnas, anatomical drawings, studies of children and animals, mythical representations, and religious works. This book reproduces 46 of his finest drawings, embodying most of his artistic themes and techniques, and executed in his characteristic media of pen and ink, and red and black chalk. The extraordinary strength, grace, and clarity of his renderings are beautifully illustrated on every page. The compositions, carefully reproduced on fine-quality paper, range from youthful studies modeled after ancient sculpture and early Renaissance frescoes to the otherworldly religious creations of his old age. Many are preliminary drawings executed in connection with some of his most important commissions: the marble David of 1501-04; the famous cartoon of 1504 for the projected fresco in the Palazzo Vecchio, The Battle of Cascina; the paintings on the vaulted ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, executed 1508-12; and the imposing fresco of The Last Judgment in the same chapel, executed 1535-14; as well as several of the more highly finished allegorical presentation drawings of the early 1530s. In some cases, e.g. The Battle of Cascina, the drawings are all that remain of a lost masterpiece. All drawings are accompanied by brief descriptive captions including date, medium, size, and current location.","longDescription":"Dover Fine Art, History of Art: Michelangelo Life Drawings (Paperback)","brandName":"Michelangelo","thumbnailImage":"https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/a8b762ce-51ab-439d-a2da-26012311f200.4f4f014094d56e5f22c8b30992cb6ac2.jpeg?odnHeight=100&odnWidth=100&odnBg=ffffff","mediumImage":"https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/a8b762ce-51ab-439d-a2da-26012311f200.4f4f014094d56e5f22c8b30992cb6ac2.jpeg?odnHeight=180&odnWidth=180&odnBg=ffffff","largeImage":"https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/a8b762ce-51ab-439d-a2da-26012311f200.4f4f014094d56e5f22c8b30992cb6ac2.jpeg?odnHeight=450&odnWidth=450&odnBg=ffffff","productTrackingUrl":"https://goto.walmart.com/c/3568462/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F428543","ninetySevenCentShipping":false,"standardShipRate":5.99,"marketplace":false,"shipToStore":false,"freeShipToStore":false,"customerRating":"5.0","numReviews":1,"bestMarketplacePrice":{"price":7.89,"sellerInfo":"Walmart.com","standardShipRate":4.31,"availableOnline":true,"clearance":false},"categoryNode":"4044_1154295_1156072","rhid":"","bundle":false,"clearance":false,"preOrder":false,"stock":"Available","freight":false,"affiliateAddToCartUrl":"https://goto.walmart.com/c/3568462/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=http%3A%2F%2Faffil.walmart.com%2Fcart%2FaddToCart%3Fitems%3D428543","freeShippingOver35Dollars":true,"maxItemsInOrder":3,"giftOptions":{},"availableOnline":true,"offerId":"DD4518501D57411DB4D5795F85C61EAB"},{"itemId":792300,"parentItemId":792300,"name":"Word Painting: A Guide to Writing More Descriptively","msrp":16.99,"salePrice":11.33,"upc":"035313107092","categoryPath":"Home Page/Home/Decor/Wall Decor/Shop All Wall Decor","shortDescription":"Word Painting: A Guide to Writing More Descriptively Format: Paperback Authors: Rebecca McClanahan ISBN10: 1582970254 Published: 2000-08-15","longDescription":"Let Rebecca McClanahan guide you through an inspiring examination of description in its many forms.

Full Screen Year: 2006 Theatrical Release: 2006-09-01 Video Release: 2006-12-19 Studio: Warner Bros. Genre: Suspense MPAA Rating: PG-13 CARA: disturbing images and violence, language and thematic issues Color: Color Runtime: 102 Animated: Live-Action Full Synopsis: Out patrolling a California highway, police officer Edward Malus stops a station wagon to return a little girl's lost doll. Moments later, a runaway truck slams into the station wagon, igniting it into a fiery wreck with the mother and child trapped inside. Edwards fails to save them before the car explodes--and then spends months of his life choking down pills to get the image of their faces out of his head. But Edward is about to get a second chance. A desperate letter from his former fiancee, Willow, arrives at his home with no postmark. Willow came into his life and left just as unexpectedly years before. But now, her daughter Rowan has gone missing, and Edward is the only person she trusts to help relocate her. She asks him to come to her home on a private island--Summersisle--a place with its own traditions where people observe a forgotten way of life. Edward seizes the opportunity to make his life right again, and soon finds himself on a seaplane bound for the islands of the Pacific Northwest. But nothing is what it seems on isolated Summersisle, where a culture, dominated by its matriarch Sister Summersisle, is bound together by arcane traditions and a pagan festival known as the Day of Death and Rebirth. The secretive people of Summersisle only ridicule his investigation, insisting that a child named Rowan never existed there--or if she ever did was no longer alive. But what Edward doesn't know is that Willow's plea for help has invited more into his life than a chance for redemption. In unraveling Summersisle's closely held secrets, Edward is drawn into a web of ancient traditions and murderous deceit, and each step he takes closer to the lost child brings him one step closer to the unspeakable. And one step closer to The Wicker Man.

Lightweight at just 23 pounds, yet still powerful enough to easily support up to 275 pounds, and has met and exceeded ANSI-BIFMA Commercial Standards Testing. Movement is not a problem with the five-star nylon base with heavy-duty hooded double-wheel casters. A standard task chair size of 25\" W x 25\" D x 35-40\" H, it has multiple ergonomic features and adjustment options. Not only can users move the height up and down using the pneumatic gas lift, but they can also adjust the depth of the back. The perks of full swivel and tilt, but perhaps the best features are the built-in lumbar support and waterfall seat design. From dorm room to craft room, office reception desk to the garage workbench, you'll find comfort and quality construction with this reliable computer chair.
